            <p>In Aim & Drop, there is a parrot flying in the air. You can control<br>
            when the parrot can poop. The goal of the game is to poop on a man<br>
            when he passes by. The kind of scoring system I implement is a score<br>
            of having three tries to poop on a man. The randomness occurs when<br>
            the man appears as he comes across the screen when it is expected. <br>
            The game becomes harder when you pick on different levels of<br>
            difficulty. You are able to win the game if you are able to poop on<br>
            the man within three tries. If you fail to do so within the given tries<br>
            then you lose.</p>
            <p>I created this game because I wanted to make a simple game enough <br>
            for everyone can play, but I wanted it to be unique enough compared to<br>
            the other games being created. My inspiration of the game's concept<br>
            came from a similar game called Space Shooter. One successful point<br>
            in my game was making the background shift back and forth to another<br>
            background image in order to make the game look like it was moving <br>
            forward continuously. Another successful point was my game's homepage<br>
            as I was able to make it easy enough for my users to navigate through.<br>
            However, I struggle to create certain parts of the game. For example,<br>
            I struggle to make the man to move across the screen and disspear<br>
            once it reaches the other end of the screen. I was able to solve this<br>
            problem by using a block for it to move across the x axis until it <br>
            hits -235 on the x axis. Once it reaches this point, I added a <br>
            "delete this clone" block so the sprite will disappear. Another<br>
            obstacle was figuring how to make the homepage hide once the game<br>
            starts. I soon was able to realize that I could utilize the broadcast<br>
            block to help me the solve this problem. First I used a "if" block <br>
            and said that if this level of difficulty or tutorial is chosen then<br>
            it would send a broadcast to the other sprites to disappear, and it <br>
            would send one to itself to hide as well. Then I inputted this into <br>
            the other homepage sprite to do the same. If I had more time to <br>
            improve my game, then I would've added more diversity in the people<br>
            for the parrot to poop on. Also I would've made the people have a <br>
            reaction and do a certain action once the bird does poop on them.</p>
          <h2>Algorithm</h2>
            <img src="algorithm.png" alt= algorithm>
            <p>An algorithm that is important to the game is this "if-else" <br>
            statement that is used to moderate and control the speed the man<br>
            depending on the level of difficulty chosen. For instance, if <br>
            the hard level was chosen then the man would receive a broadcast to<br>
            activate this certain script. This specific script is an algorithm <br>
            because it executes step to step commands and utilizes a specific set<br>
            of instructions. For example, once the script receives a broadcast to<br>
            activate it, then it goes through the first step of an "if-else" block<br>
            which tells it to set the speed to -15 if the timer is less than 5 <br>
            seconds. However if the timer surpasses 5 seconds then it will execute<br>
            the second step to change the speed to -17, or else, if the time is<br>
            past 20 seconds then this will lead to the last step which is to<br>
            increase the speed up to -20.</p>

            <p> In the Choose Your Own Adventure game, "Friends", a boy is asked<br>
            to hang out with his friends. From that moment, the player is able<br>
            to control the boy's actions as they are allowed to make decisions<br>
            for him. However, the player must choose wisely because depending on <br>
            their choice, this may lead the boy to either a good or bad outcome.</p>
            <a href= "https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1UB3xn8CSIx-t5P3AfEr3kPuWoYmZ-JyWkU07LLB-bgo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">

            <p>The game, "Friends", was a process of incremental development as <br>
            I created a flow map to build the game's storyline, including defining<br>
            game's major funtions: intro(),leave_home(), stay_home(), robber_enter(),<br>
            late(),and punctual(); containing the details of the story. Another<br>
            incremental process was allowing all the scenes connect to each other.<br>
            I had to call out the function inside the definition of another function<br>
            so the scene would flow to the next one. An iterative process I faced <br>
            was when the game wouldn't stop when it reached a conclusion, <br>
            continuing to run another outcome. This was due to calling out<br>
            multiple functions when I only needed to call the first function. <br>
            Another obstacle I encountered was when I was when I received in error<br>
            when I typed yes or no. I realized my while statements were incorrect<br>
            since I wrote that while the answer != "x" or "x", when it should've<br>
            been "not in [x, x]" since it included the letters that are necessary<br>
            for the statement to function.</p>
            
            <p> Organizing the scenes of my story are a procedural abstraction<br>
            because it allows the code to become simplified as the coder is able<br>
            to just call on the function using just a word. Furthermore, by having<br>
            each scene being called on one at a time, this creates an organized<br>
            procedure and makes it easier for the coder to locate specific scenes.</p>
            
            <p> A story that I liked was "Love O2O" because the program flowed <br>
            very smoothly. Furthermore, even though the genre romance is usually<br>
            cliche, this game's romance storyline was very unique in compraison<br>
            to normal stories of this genre. Hence, that is why I found "Love O2O"<br>
            very memorable.</p>
